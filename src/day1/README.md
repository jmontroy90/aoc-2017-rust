Day 1:
- Lots of Rust syntax to get used to again! As always, Rust is incredibly exacting in what it expects, and doesn't allow you to cut any corners whatsoeber.
- I misread the prompt at first, and ended up doing a subscan solution that counted for contiguous numbers, not just "one index away".
- I'm not sold on Rust tests. I like table tests and will look for a framework that does that.
